# Tren de la Costa, Buenos Aires, Argentina

The Tren de la Costa route is a light railway that follows the coast just north of the Argentinian capital of Buenos Aires from Delta, near Tigre to connections with the Mitre Line at Maip√∫ Avenue.
The route is quite short at only 15.5km long with trains travelling an average speed of just 35km/h, the trip taking around 30 minutes one way. Services are operated by two-car tram-like train sets with a capacity of 200 passengers.
The line was opened between 1891 and 1896, and later became electrified in 1931.

## Simulation

The simulation is an easy to operate experience covering the full route and following a weekday timetable which sees a train every 30 minutes. The only challenge is in ensuring level crossings are operated correctly being
opened to allow sufficient traffic flow, but also closed in time to prevent service delay.
